# Movie Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a movie dataset to gain insights and perform various data analysis tasks. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter notebook, and it includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
Before you can run the code in this repository, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

### Install Required Libraries
The following Python libraries are required to run the code. You can install them using `pip`.

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Additional Tools
Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to open and run the `.ipynb` file. You can install Jupyter Notebook using:

```sh
pip install notebook
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone
    https://github.com/Tvishak16/Movie-Review-Classification.git

   cd Movie-Review-Classification
   ```


2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Start Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Then open the `Movie.ipynb` notebook file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. **Data Loading:**
   Load the movie dataset provided in the notebook.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   Follow the steps in the notebook to clean and preprocess the data.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   Perform various data analysis tasks as described in the notebook. This includes visualizing data distributions, performing statistical tests, and building predictive models.

4. **Visualization:**
   Generate visualizations to gain insights into the data. Use libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting.

5. **Modeling:**
   Build and evaluate machine learning models using Scikit-learn.

## Project Structure

- `Movie.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset (if applicable).
- `images/`: Directory for saving plots and images generated during analysis (if applicable).
